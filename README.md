# SpotOn.it

Make sure you have NodeJS installed and run the following from a command prompt:

-   git clone https://github.com/cognitronic/spoton.it.git
-   From the root directory run: npm install
-   Then run: grunt build
-   Start the server by running: node server.js
-   Browse to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the landing page! :)
   

I'm also running a version at: http://spoton.ravenartmedia.com.  It might be kinda slow, it's just my personal IIS server.

Also, check out the generated documentation under **doc/index.html** and the code coverage report under: **coverage/PhantomJS 1.9.8 (Windows 8)/index.html**
